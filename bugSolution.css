The following CSS code provides a more robust and cross-browser compatible solution using flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the element's total width and height. */
}
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

This code uses flexbox to distribute the space evenly between the divs. The `box-sizing` property helps to avoid inconsistencies caused by padding or borders.
